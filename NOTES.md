# Performance notes

Measurements for the M2 vs M3 comparison. M2 renders naively on the main thread; M3
replaces it with a worker, ring buffers and LTTB. The value of these numbers depends
entirely on both milestones being measured the same way, so the method is recorded here
alongside the results.

## Method

- **Machine:** Windows 11, 16 logical cores, 32 GB RAM. Chromium 152, JS heap limit 4192 MB.
- **Environment:** host, not the dev container (see README). Server and Vite both local.
- **Server:** defaults — 4 channels at 1000 Hz, 50 ms batches, seed 1. 200 samples per
  batch, 20 batches per second, 4000 samples per second.
- **Harness:** `web/src/bench/`. Samples once a second: fps from `requestAnimationFrame`
  intervals, heap from `performance.memory`, freezes from a `longtask` PerformanceObserver,
  and main-thread time spent inside `renderer.push`.
- **Stop conditions:** 10 minutes, or fps below 10 for three consecutive samples, or a
  single long task over 2000 ms.
- **Retention:** unbounded in both M2 modes. Growing memory is the phenomenon under test.

### Caveats worth stating up front

- `performance.memory` is non-standard, Chromium-only, and a coarse estimate. GC timing
  makes the series non-monotonic; the peak is more meaningful than any single reading.
  `performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory()` would be better but needs
  `crossOriginIsolated`, which this dev setup does not have.
- **ECharts' built-in `sampling: 'lttb'` is deliberately not enabled** in any mode. Letting
  the library downsample would hide the cost M3 exists to remove. It is also not a
  substitute: built-in sampling still requires every point to be in main-thread memory,
  whereas the M3 design bounds memory with ring buffers.
- **fps requires a visible window.** A hidden or backgrounded tab schedules no animation
  frames, so fps reads 0 regardless of how healthy the renderer is. The harness records
  visibility per sample and marks such a run `invalid` rather than `failed` — an early
  version of this reported a spurious failure from a hidden tab, which is exactly the kind
  of fabricated number that would not survive scrutiny.
- **Do not poll the page during a run.** Reading results mid-run executes on the same main
  thread being measured and puts artificial zeroes in the fps series. Runs below were
  started, left alone, and read only after finishing.

## Mode A — naive `setOption`

Every sample is kept in a plain JS array, and every batch hands ECharts the entire dataset
again. Quadratic over a run: batch *n* re-serialises everything the previous *n-1* batches
already sent.

**Result: failed after 22.0 s, holding 85,600 points.** That is roughly 21 seconds of data,
about 3.5% of the spec's 2.4M-point target.

| Time | Points held | Main thread busy | fps | Heap MB | Long tasks (max ms) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 s | 4,000 | 15% | 60 | 26 | 0 |
| 5 s | 20,000 | 28% | 60 | 40 | 0 |
| 9 s | 36,000 | 47% | 60 | 38 | 0 |
| 13 s | 52,000 | 71% | 60 | 90 | 0 |
| 15 s | 60,000 | 77% | 60 | 58 | 0 |
| 16 s | 64,200 | 96% | 0 | 115 | 2 (57) |
| 18 s | 70,600 | >100% | 2 | 183 | 15 (215) |
| 22 s | 85,600 | >100% | 1 | 211 | 27 (552) |

Summary: p50 fps 59.9, min 0. Heap 26 → 211 MB. 27 long tasks, longest 552 ms. Peak single
`push` 69.7 ms. Time to first bad sample: 16.1 s.

### What the numbers say

**The failure has a knee, not a slope.** fps sat at a solid 60 until 15 s and then fell off
a cliff within one second. Watching fps alone, the chart looks perfectly healthy right up
to the moment it is unusable — which is why fps is a poor early-warning signal.

**Main-thread busy time is the honest leading indicator.** It rose linearly and predictably
— 15% → 28% → 47% → 71% → 77% — crossing 100% at exactly the point fps collapsed. It was
telling us the answer ten seconds before fps did.

**Past saturation, busy time exceeds 100%.** Once the thread cannot keep up, the harness's
own 1-second `setInterval` stops firing on time, so a "one second" sample covers more than
a second of wall clock. The 407% reading at 22 s means roughly 4 seconds of `push` work
landed in one nominal sample. `peakBusyPercent` is clamped to 100 in the summary; the raw
series is not.

**Individual pushes never got catastrophically slow** — the worst was 69.7 ms. The problem
is not one slow call, it is 20 of them per second. Long tasks tell the same story from the
other side: 27 of them, up to 552 ms.

## Mode B — ECharts `appendData`

**Status: not yet recorded.**

The renderer is implemented (`web/src/render/append.ts`) and runs. Capturing its numbers is
blocked on an environment constraint rather than on the code: the Browser pane used for
automation hides itself when the desktop window is not in the foreground, and a hidden pane
schedules no animation frames and cannot be scripted at all. Runs complete but their results
cannot be read back, and the visibility guard correctly refuses to report them.

Recording this requires the window kept in the foreground for the duration of the run.

### What to capture when it runs

The interesting comparison is **not** time-to-failure but cost at a matched point count:
mode A was saturated at 85,600 points, so mode B's busy percentage at that same figure is
the number that matters. Time-to-failure is a secondary datum, since it mostly measures
how long it takes to accumulate points rather than the per-point cost.

### Design note found while building it

`appendData` runs a restricted update cycle in which only data may be modified; coordinate
systems and axes are rebuilt only on a full update. So `appendData` alone **cannot advance a
scrolling time axis** — it feeds points in while the axis stays put. `AppendRenderer` pairs
it with a `setOption` carrying only `xAxis.min/max`, throttled to once a second, because
that call is the expensive one it is trying to avoid. Series data is deliberately excluded
from that option, since including it would reset what `appendData` accumulated.

## M3 target

M3 must beat mode A on the same harness, and the bar is low: survive past 22 seconds and
85,600 points. The real target is the spec's acceptance criterion — 4 channels at 1 kHz for
15+ minutes, a 10-minute window visible, 30+ fps, no multi-second freezes. That is roughly
2.4M points, about 28x what the naive renderer managed before collapsing.

The two numbers to watch are **points rendered** (LTTB should hold this near `2 × widthPx`,
a few thousand, regardless of how many are held) and **main-thread busy time** (which should
stay flat as points held grows, rather than rising linearly).
